      <p>Hello. My name is Alan.</p>
      <p>My website – and I’m sorry, but you’re not going to like this – wasn’t made for you.</p>
      <p>It does this thing. It... Well, this is hard to explain, but it does this... <em>thing</em>. And the thing only works because of Javascript. And you seem to have Javascript disabled, or unavailable, or, well you know your computer – your <em>device</em> – better than me, but at any rate, this thing my website does, it can’t do it for you. Not with Javascript unavailable, or disabled, or however you want to look at it, like, out of the picture.</p>
      <p>So it wasn’t made for you in that sense, but I hope you understand that this isn’t something personal, this isn't me in any way <em>judging</em> you. I’m still glad you’re here, I’d still like to talk to you – you know, if you’d like to talk to me, I don’t want to be too forward. Too presumptuous. But you know, if you’d like, you can still email me. I'm <a href="mailto:alantrotter@gmail.com">alantrotter@gmail.com</a>.</p>
      <p>And that’s all there really is at the other website, I mean the one that needs Javascript. That’s all there is, you know, content-wise. There’s that, and there's I suppose a link to me on <a href="http://twitter.com/alantrotter">Twitter</a> and on <a href="http://notes.greaterthanorequalto.net">Tumblr</a>.</p>
      <p>Oh and I guess it mentions a short story I wrote, ‘<a href="http://greaterthanorequalto.net/a-hospital-for-boys">A Hospital for Boys</a>’ which you can get. It’s one of those things where you can pay whatever you want, even if that’s nothing, and you get it. As an ebook, I mean, you can download it as an ebook. The website, the other website, the real, thing-doing, Javascript website mentions that.</p>
      <p>I really am sorry that this is all you can see. It took me a lot of time, the other website, and I think you’d have liked it, maybe. Got something out of it, perhaps. Anyway. Never mind. No use.</p>
      <p>Unless, maybe another time you’ll be able to see it. On another computer, or device. Or with Javascript enabled. Or not. I’ve probably taken up enough of your time. But thank you anyway, for coming here. For reading this.</p>
